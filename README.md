This is a Restaurant Page Project, done for The Odin Project's FullStack Javascript Path.

I practiced using Webpack to manage my modules and import/exports, I also added an extra challenge of having every element not only dynamically created in JS but also creating it with a function that took a JSON as input.

I enjoyed this project, even if I already had some trouble with asset management, I think it might be because a module was adding "src" and "href" attributes and then webpack was not counting the path that was provided as an asset to transfer to the dist folder, but it might be an error on my end too.

I now want to learn further how to troubleshoot problems with webpack.
